[TablerIcons](https://tabler-icons.io) is a set of over 4050 free MIT-licensed high-quality SVG
icons for you to use in your projects.

This library offers you the vector drawable version of these icons with some additional features that you can easily use in your Android projects.

## Adding to your project

### 1. Adding the library repository

If you're using the old project structure, add **JitPack** in your root `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file like this:

<details>
<summary><code>build.gradle</code></summary>

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven {
            url 'https://jitpack.io'
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>build.gradle.kts</code></summary>

```kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven {
            url = uri("https://jitpack.io")
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

Otherwise if you're using new project structure, add **JitPack** in your `settings.gradle` or `settings.gradle.kts` like this:

<details>
<summary><code>settings.gradle</code></summary>

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    ...
    repositories {
        ...
        maven {
            url 'https://jitpack.io'
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>settings.gradle.kts</code></summary>

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    ...
    repositories {
        ...
        maven {
            url = uri("https://jtipack.io")
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

### 2. Adding the library dependency

Now add the library dependency in your application module `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts` file like this:


<details>
<summary><code>build.gradle</code></summary>

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    def tablerIconsVersion = "0.9.0" // You can find the latest version from releases page
    implementation "ir.alirezaivaz:tablericons:$tablerIconsVersion"
}
```

</details>

<details open>
<summary><code>build.gradle.kts</code></summary>

```kotlin
dependencies {
    ...
    val tablerIconsVersion = "0.9.0" // You can find the latest version from releases page
    implementation("ir.alirezaivaz:tablericons:$tablerIconsVersion")
}
```

</details>

## Usage

Just call the desired icon from the drawables like this:
```xml
<ImageView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:src="@drawable/ic_arrow_back" />
```

You can see the list of icons categorized on [this page](https://tabler-icons.io).

> **Note:** The names of all icons in this library start with `ic_` and instead of `-` (dash) you should use `_` (underline).<br>
> E.g: If you want to use an icon named `arrow-back`, you should change its name to `ic_arrow_back`.

### Change the color of icons

If you want to change the color of all icons at once, override `tabler_icon` to your `colors.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    ...
    <color name="tabler_icon">#2196F3</color>
</resources>
```

Otherwise, if you want to change the color of one icon, just use `app:tint` attribute in your `ImageView` like this:

```xml
<ImageView
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:src="@drawable/ic_arrow_back"
    app:tint="#2196F3" />
```
